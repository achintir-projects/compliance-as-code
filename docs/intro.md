# GlassBox AI Standard v1.0

**The Global Operating System for Regulatory Technology**

GlassBox AI Standard v1.0 is a comprehensive framework for regulatory compliance that provides standardized formats, tools, and methodologies for managing compliance across industries and jurisdictions.

## What is GlassBox AI Standard?

GlassBox AI Standard is an open-source initiative that aims to:

- **Standardize compliance data formats** through DecisionBundle JSON schema
- **Simplify rule creation** with the Compliance DSL (Domain-Specific Language)
- **Enable interoperability** between compliance systems and regulators
- **Provide comprehensive tooling** for developers and compliance officers
- **Support regulatory innovation** through open standards and collaboration

## Key Components

### 1. DecisionBundle Specification
A standardized JSON schema for packaging compliance decisions, rules, and evidence:
- **Structured metadata** for regulatory context
- **Multiple rule types** (DSL, expression, decision tables)
- **Audit trails** and digital signatures
- **Evidence management** with cryptographic verification

### 2. Compliance DSL
A human-readable domain-specific language for defining compliance rules:
- **Natural language syntax** for accessibility
- **Minimal grammar** for easy learning
- **Support for complex conditions** and temporal constraints
- **Executable rules** that can be processed by compliance engines

### 3. Reference SDKs
Official software development kits for multiple platforms:
- **Python SDK** for data science and ML workflows
- **JavaScript SDK** for web applications and APIs
- **Java SDK** for enterprise systems integration

### 4. Regulator Sandbox
A secure environment for regulators to:
- **Ingest and validate** DecisionBundles
- **Query compliance data** by rule and jurisdiction
- **Generate audit reports** and export findings
- **Test compliance scenarios** with sample data
